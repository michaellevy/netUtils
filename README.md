# Network Utilities

Some functions for doing things with networks that I often do. These functions are intended to work with `network`, i.e. `statnet` objects, not `igraph`. If you'd like to install this package for your own use, you should be able to do so via these lines in R:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("michaellevy/netUtils")
```
